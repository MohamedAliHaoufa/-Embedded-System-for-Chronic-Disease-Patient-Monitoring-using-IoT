# Embedded-System-for-Chronic-Disease-Patient-Monitoring-using-IoT

This project aims to develop an embedded system that monitors chronic disease patients who need frequent medical check-ups.

This embedded system uses a Raspberry Pi 4b to gather data from several sensors installed in patients' bodies, and their data is constantly saved, analyzed and processed to extract vital details about their health and transfer it safely using MQTT protocol with the help of security encryption (AES Algorithm) to the IoT cloud where it is organized into an interface making it easier to use and understand, which allows users like doctors to easily access patientsâ€™ data and observing their health state from any place in the world. 

To enhance the functionality of the system, a warning system (Email/SMS) has been integrated into the IoT platform, which warns the doctor when the patient enters an abnormal state.

The budget and the outcome of this project are reasonable compared to what the patients pay for their Regular medical check-ups.
